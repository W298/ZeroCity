**Procedural City-Generation** Project.

This project is a sub-project of the [FindingYonghee](https://youtu.be/IbnIGOHuBFU?si=1Ml9hwgt_yT7VyK0) project.

- `FindingYonghee` project has further implemented a Crowd Simulation based on Reinforcement Learning.
- This project only handles City-Generation.

## About the code

- Every City-Generating Code is at [CityGenerator.cs](https://github.com/W298/zeroCity/blob/master/Assets/CityGeneration/Scripts/CityGenerator.cs) file.
- Detail step-by-step descriptions are provided in the [Documentation](https://w298.github.io/zeroCity).
- You can download executable file from [Release](https://github.com/W298/zeroCity/releases).

_[Warning] Because this project was developed with paid assets (3D models, toolkits), we intentionally did not upload them to this repository, so even if you download those assets and run the project, it may not work properly. If you want to test this project, please use [released executable file](https://github.com/W298/zeroCity/releases)._
